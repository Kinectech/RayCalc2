# RayCalc2
<p>A cross-platform radiation dosimetry app for emergency situations!</p>

What is RayCalc?
RayCalc is a lightweight, simple calculator for radiation dosimetry calculations when on call. Its purpose is not to replace professional software, but to provide a verification solution during emergency situations to aid against human error. The calculator utilizes data tables taken directly from Northside Forsyth hospital, and uses industry-standard formulas, along with some minor interpolation to obtain answers that have been tested to be with a less than 1% error margin.

Can I change the ISO setting?
As of this moment, no. At this moment the ability to change the machine ISO is not possible because of the data used within the calculations. If a need is recognized, this feature will be added.

What about gold-beam data?
The introduction of gold-beam data tables is intended to be implemented in a future date. The benefit of this is that gold-beam data is being widely adopted throughout clinics and hospitals as a standard. 

Will you add more calculation types?
It is possible that in the future more calculation types will be added. This feature will be added if there are requests for it.

Which devices does the app support?
This app is designed using the ionic framework, meaning it supports both iOS and Android and can run locally on Windows, Mac, and Linux via a web browser.

I would like to report an error/bug report.
All bugs are taken very seriously, and will be resolved as fast as possible. Please be sure to be concise as to how you ran into the bug, including the steps taken to do so.
