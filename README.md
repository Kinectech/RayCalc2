<p>A cross-platform radiation dosimetry app for emergency situations!</p>

<strong>What is RayCalc?</strong>
<p>
RayCalc is a lightweight, simple calculator for radiation dosimetry calculations when on call. Its purpose is not to replace professional software, but to provide a verification solution during emergency situations to aid against human error. The calculator utilizes data tables taken directly from Northside Forsyth hospital, and uses industry-standard formulas, along with some minor interpolation to obtain answers that have been tested to be with a less than 1% error margin.
</p>


<strong>Can I change the ISO setting?</strong>
<p>
As of this moment, no. At this moment the ability to change the machine ISO is not possible because of the data used within the calculations. If a need is recognized, this feature will be added.
</p>


<strong>What about gold-beam data?</strong>
<p>
The introduction of gold-beam data tables is intended to be implemented in a future date. The benefit of this is that gold-beam data is being widely adopted throughout clinics and hospitals as a standard.
</p>


<strong>Will you add more calculation types?</strong>
<p>
It is possible that in the future more calculation types will be added. This feature will be added if there are requests for it.
</p>


<strong>Which devices does the app support?</strong>
<p>
This app is designed using the ionic framework, meaning it supports both iOS and Android and can run locally on Windows, Mac, and Linux via a web browser.
